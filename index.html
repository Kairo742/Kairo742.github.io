    <h2>Game Development</h2>
    <h4>Game 1 (Unfinished): Sin-Eater</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/Kairo742/Sin-Eater">Repository</a>
    <p>I must admit that while this is an unfinished project, the concepts still have my heart.
      I sincerely look forward to finishing it one day!</p>

    <h4>Game 2 (Unfinished): Popsicle Sticks</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/Kairo742/Popsicles">Repository</a>
    <p>Popsicle Sticks was a game I began working on after pausing previous projects for fears of overscoping.
    I took inspiration from smaller games that strayed from the common combat-roguelike loop and went after something
    more creative.</p>
    <em>This will likely be the first project that I publish, only once I've gained experience.</em>

    <h4>Game 3 (In-Progress): Transference</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/cj0fis/transference">Repository</a>
    <p>Transference is a game I am working on in a group submission to Texas A&M GameDevelopers 
    2025 Game Jam. While I mostly am focusing on Project Management, Story and Art, I am also contributing
    to programming.</p>
